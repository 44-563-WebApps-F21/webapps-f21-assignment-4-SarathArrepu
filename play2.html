            <p class ="speech">I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
                buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.</p>

            <p class ="speech"> I will speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her
                family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
                lordship complains of in the buttonhole.</p>

            <p class ="speech">Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in Englandâ€”they
                are always losing their relations.</p>
