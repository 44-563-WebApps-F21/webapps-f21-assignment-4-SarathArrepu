    <h4>THIRD ACT
        <br>
        SCENE
        <br>

        <p class ="description"> Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.</p></h4>

        <p class ="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LORD GORING _in evening dress with a buttonhole_.  _He is
        wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  _White-gloved_, _he carries a
        Louis Seize cane_.  _His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion_.
        _One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life_, _makes it
        indeed_, _and so masters it_.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
        in the history of thought_.]</p>
