    <h4>THIRD ACT
        <br>
        SCENE
        <br>

        <p> Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.</p></h4>

        <p>[_Enter_ LORD GORING _in evening dress with a buttonhole_.  _He is
        wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape_.  _White-gloved_, _he carries a
        Louis Seize cane_.  _His are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion_.
        _One sees that he stands in immediate relation to modern life_, _makes it
        indeed_, _and so masters it_.  _He is the first well-dressed philosopher
        in the history of thought_.]</p>
        
        <p> <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
            presents new buttonhole on salver_.]
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
            of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
            what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  Yes, my lord.
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  Yes, my lord.
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
            of other people.
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  Yes, my lord.
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
            is oneself.
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  Yes, my lord.
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
            Phipps.
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5>  Yes, my lord.
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5>  [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]  Don’t think I quite
            like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
            almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.
            <br>
            <h5>LORD GORING.</h5> You don’t, Phipps?
            <br>
            <h5>PHIPPS.</h5> No, my lord.</p></body>
